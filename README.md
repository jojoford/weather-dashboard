# Weather-dashboard

Description: Weather dashboard with form inputs
This project was designed to help us gain a better understanding of the use of APIs
It also involved troubleshooting and querying for particular parameters 

When the user searches for a city then the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city
that city is added to the search history
and displayed underneath search bar
The city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index display
A color indicates the whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
Future weather conditions for that city display for next 5 days
The 5-day forecast displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
A searched city is saved and listed below search bar and can be clicked on again
Then current and future conditions for that city will display

Used: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
