# Weather-dashboard

Description: Weather dashboard with form inputs
This project was designed to help us gain a better understanding of the use of APIs
It also involved troubleshooting, querying for particular parameters, using a .env & .gitignore 

When the user searches for a city then the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city
that city is added to the search history
and displayed underneath search bar
The city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
A color indicates the whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
